# Chapter 6: Comparison Operators and If-Else

In the previous chapter, we created the `battle` function which created a random pokemon.

We need to compare the wild pokemon and the trainer pokemon to return the result of the battle. For this purpose we need comparison operators.

## Comparison Operators

Different types support different comparison operators. For our use-case we will compare 2 `uint256`.

Here is a list of comparison operators supported by `uint256` type.

| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| x < y    | Less than                |
| x <= y   | Less than or equal to    |
| x == y   | Equals                   |
| x != y   | Does not equal           |
| x >= y   | Greater than or equal to |
| x > y    | Greater than             |

## If-Elif-Else statements

The `if` statement is a control flow construct used for conditional execution:

```vyper
if CONDITION:
    # do something
```

`CONDITION` is a boolean or boolean operation. The boolean is evaluated left-to-right, one expression at a time, until the condition is found to be true or false. If true, the logic in the body of the `if` statement is executed.

Note that unlike Python, Vyper does not allow implicit conversion from non-boolean types within the condition of an if statement. `if 1: pass` will fail to compile with a type mismatch.

You can also include `elif` and `else` statements, to add more conditional statements and a body that executes when the conditionals are false:

```vyper
if CONDITION:
    # do something 1
elif OTHER_CONDITION:
    # do something 2
else:
    # do something 3
```

## Put it to the test

We will compare the `HP` of the pokemons to decide the winner. If the trainer pokemon wins, the trainer gets the new pokemon.

1. Inside the `battle` function, increment the `battleCount` state variable by 1.

2. Create an `if` statement which compares the HP of the trainer `pokemon` parameter and the `randomHP` of the wild pokemon. If the HP of trainer `pokemon` is greater than `randomHP` then the trainer `pokemon` wins.

3. In the body of the `if` statement, return the following arguments:
   - Battle result: `True`
   - Wild pokemon name: `randomName`
   - Wild pokemon DNA: `randomDNA`
   - Wild pokemon HP: `randomHP`
