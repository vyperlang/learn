Let's suppose you want to translate [Chapter 1: Contracts](). First, **ADD A COMMENT in issue page, specifying the Lesson and chapter number**. In this case, you will comment "Lesson 1, Chapter 1". You can also add multiple chapters in a single comment.

**To win a Hacktoberfest T-Shirt, you need to complete and submit 4 chapters by 31st of October, 2020.**

**IF YOU SUBMIT A PULL REQUEST WITHOUT COMMENTING ON THE ISSUE, YOUR PULL REQUEST WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.**

### Step 3: Edit a file to add your translation

Now, click the link corresponding to the chapter. You will see the following page:

Click the "pencil" icon on the top right to edit the file.

![Pencil icon can be used to edit a file](https://files.gitter.im/5f4e9bc8d73408ce4fedc7e3/S901/hack-3.png)

In the first line of the file, you will find a link. In this case you will find the following link: https://vyper.fun/#/1/contract_structure
